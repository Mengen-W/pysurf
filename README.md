# Pysurf
This is the documentation for the open-source Python code - pysurf. This code will generate phase diagrams for surfaces of perovskites from density functional theory calculations. 

Powered by Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib, the code reads the formation energy calculated at chemical potentials = 0 eV and chemical compositions from a csv file, evaluates the most stable surfaces under the user-defined chemical potential region, and generates a color contour plot for the phase diagram.

An example is given for the surface phase diagram of CsPbI3, and the code is easily generalized to other materials.
